    "You can access the NFL’s Next Gen Stats data as in previous competitions. This year's player tracking includes data from Weeks 1-9 of the 2022 NFL season. Data will show the location, speed, and acceleration of all 22 players on the field, along with football location. Additional PFF scouting data and NFL advanced stats such as expected points and win probability are also included.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Predictions of tackle time, probability, and/or location\n",
    "* Tackle range: angle of pursuit, speed and acceleration, closing speed\n",
    "* Player evaluation (e.g, yards saved, tackle value, missed tackles)\n",
    "* Credit assignment (e.g, one player makes a tackle because of another players, blocks shed, area of influence)\n",
    "* Tackle type (solo vs gang, open field vs in the trenches, etc)\n",
    "* Team and player roles and responsibilities (setting the edge, filling gaps, etc)\n",
